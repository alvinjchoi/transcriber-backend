The Speex encoding supported by Cloud Speech API has a header byte in each block, as in MIME type audio/x-speex-with-header-byte. It is a variant of the RTP Speex encoding defined in RFC 5574. The stream is a sequence of blocks, one block per RTP packet. Each block starts with a byte containing the length of the block, in bytes, followed by one or more frames of Speex data, padded to an integral number of bytes (octets) as specified in RFC 5574. In other words, each RTP header is replaced with a single byte containing the block length. Only Speex wideband is supported. sampleRateHertz must be 16000.
